<h3>“Never disappointed when I stop at Bakery. We’ve got birthday cakes, cupcakes, cookies, pepperoni rolls 
and novelty cakes there over the years, it’s all fresh and delicious. The employees are friendly and helpful and the prices are very reasonable.
Cold brew fans, Patti’s is the best around.” </h3>

<h3>“We initially chose Bakery due to the location. It was very close to our wedding venue. From the initial 
contact to the delivery, everything was great. We chose 2 different layers/flavors: almond raspberry & strawberry champagne.
Both were incredibly delicious and our guests were coming back for seconds!” </h3>
